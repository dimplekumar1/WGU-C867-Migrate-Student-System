# **University Student System Migration and Data Management in C++**

## **Project Description:**

This project is designed to assist a university in migrating their existing student system to a new platform using the C++ programming language. The main objective was to implement a system that reads and manipulates student data efficiently.

## **Key Features:**

1. **Data Migration:** Seamlessly transferring student information, including student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, course completion durations, and degree program, from the legacy system to the new platform.

2. **C++ Implementation:** The program that employs C++ to create two essential classes: Student and Roster. These classes efficiently manage the student data, enabling easy access and manipulation of information.

3. **Data Parsing and Storage:** The program efficiently parses a list of five students and creates student objects for each of them. The entire student list is stored in an array called classRosterArray, ensuring proper organization and retrieval of student data during runtime.

4. **Functionality for Data Manipulation:** The implemented program provides function calls that facilitate data manipulation tasks, including adding and removing students, updating student records, and generating data-related output to the console.

## **How to Use:**

The repository contains the complete C++ source code for the project. To utilize it, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Compile the C++ code using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio, etc.).
3. Run the compiled executable, and it will demonstrate the functionality of the student system, as described in the project specifications.
